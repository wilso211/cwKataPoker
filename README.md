Kata Poker Hands - Object-Oriented Showcase

This application was created within the
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Version: Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)

The purpose is to create a game of poker between two players, then tests their hands to see who wins.

The deck is created unshuffled, then shuffled between 0-50 times. The shuffle is not random and is not expected to be. 

Whenever the application is run: a deck will be created, shuffled, hands will be dealt, and a winner will be determined.

Because of the nature of the shuffle, hands will be seen as repeated, but this is expected.
